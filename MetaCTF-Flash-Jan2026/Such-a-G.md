# Such a G writeup
## this is my writeup for the "Such a G" challenge from MetaCTF jan 2026 flash ctf

Provided is an unknown binary file, rectangle.g  

The first thing I did was use xxd to view the bytes the start of the binary to try to find out what it is:  

```shell
xxd rectangle.g
```
Which gave me

```

```
This shows that the file is a 3d print gcode file generated by prusaslicer software.  

The next thing I tried was using binwalk to see if there was anything else hidden in the binary:

```shell
binwalk -e rectangle.g
```
This actually showed that there was a PNG inside the binary, but after looking in the binwalk -e directory, there was only gcode and compressed versions of the gcode  

The next thing to do was try to render it and see if the flag was hidden in the 3d model itsself.  

After installing prusaslicer software and loading the file rectangle.g I saw a rectangle, except when using the slider to change the number of layers, it would reveal characters of the flag at certain points.  

After going through all the layers slowly to get each character. I had the full flag:

Flag: (copy over when I get home)
