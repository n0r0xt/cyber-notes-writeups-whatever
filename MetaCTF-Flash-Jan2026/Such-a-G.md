# Such a G writeup
## this is my writeup for the "Such a G" challenge from MetaCTF jan 2026 flash ctf

Provided is an unknown binary file, rectangle.g  

The first thing I did was use xxd to view the bytes of the binary to try to find out what it is:  

```shell
xxd rectangle.g
```
The start of which looked like this:

```
00000000: 4743 4445 0100 0000 0100 0000 0000 1b00  GCDE............
00000010: 0000 0000 5072 6f64 7563 6572 3d50 7275  ....Producer=Pru

00000050: 6669 6c61 6d65 6e74 5f74 7970 653d 504c  filament_type=PL
```
This shows that the file is a 3d print gcode file generated by prusaslicer software.  

The next thing I tried was using binwalk to see if there was anything else hidden in the binary:

```shell
binwalk -e rectangle.g
```
This actually showed that there was a PNG inside the binary, but after looking in the binwalk -e directory, there was only gcode and compressed versions of the gcode  

The next thing to do was try to render it and see if the flag was hidden in the 3d model itsself.  

After installing prusaslicer software and loading the file rectangle.g I saw a rectangle, except when using the slider to change the number of layers, it would reveal characters of the flag at certain points.  

After going through all the layers slowly to get each character, I had the full flag:

Flag: MetaCTF{sl1c3d_and_d1c3d}
