# Just a little bit writeup
## this is my writeup for the just a little bit warmup challenge in huntress CTF 2025

Here's some binary:
```shell
11001101101100110000111001111111011011001011000110110011011001111000110110001011011001110011100001
11001011100010110010011001100110010110010111001010110011011000111001010110011011100001110010110101
1100100011010101110010110110011011011001000111001011001111001101111101
```
The challenge says "If just a little bit were to go missing... would it really even matter?"
Solve by converting from binary but with a bit length of 7:
```shell
flag{2c33c169aebdf2ee31e3895d5966d93f}
```
